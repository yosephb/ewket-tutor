    "BIOLOGY GRADE 11\n\nThe human body is a biological machine made of body systems and groups of organs that work together to produce and sustain life. The human organ systems include the integumentary system, skeletal system, muscular system, lymphatic system, respiratory system, digestive system, nervous system, endocrine system, cardiovascular system, urinary system and reproductive systems.\n\nHowever, in this unit, we shall discuss only the musculoskeletal and reproductive systems.\n\n5.1. Human Musculoskeletal Systems\n\nThe human musculoskeletal systems are organ systems that give humans the ability to move.\n\nMuscles and skeletal systems are musculoskeletal systems that provide the human body with shapes and forms and protect the vital organs of musculoskeletal systems. Musculoskeletal systems Unit learning outcomes After the successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:\n\n1. Explain the structure and function of the musculoskeletal system.\n\n2.

Types of muscles\n\nThe human muscular systems include about 700 muscles that make up half of the human body weight and are responsible for the movement of the human body.\n\nHuman muscles are discrete organs made of skeletal muscle tissues, blood vessels, tendons and nerves found attached to the bones of the skeletal system.\n\nWhat are the functions of muscles?",
    "The human body is composed of three types of muscles:\n\n1. Cardiac muscles\n\n2. Skeletal muscles\n\n3. Smooth muscles\n\n1. The Cardiac muscles\n\nT he cardiac muscle (heart muscle) forms a thick middle layer between the outer layer of the heart wall (pericardium), and the inner layer (endocardium) with blood supplied to circulate via the coronary circulation.\n\nThe cardiac muscle is an involuntary striated muscle composed of tissues of the wall of the heart called myocardium.\n\nIndividual cardiac muscle cells are joined together by intercalated discs and are encased by collagen fibers to form the extracellular matrix (Figure 5.2).\n\nFigure 5.2 Cardiac muscles\n\n2. The Skeletal Muscle\n\nThe skeletal muscles arranged in opposing systems around joints are attached to bones and are composed of 30 to 40% of total body mass (Figure 5.3). They allow the body to perform a wide range of movements and functions such as voluntary controlled systems on works. The skeletal muscle fibers innervated by a single motor axon are called a motor unit.",

The Smooth Muscles\n\nThe smooth muscles are involuntary, non-striated and unconsciously controlled muscles that control the flow of substances within the lumens.\n\nThe Smooth muscles are muscles found in the walls of hollow organs: the stomach, intestine, bladder, uterus and walls of passageways of the blood and lymph vessels, respiratory tracts, urinary and reproductive systems, in the eyes and the ciliary muscles (Figure 5.4). The smooth muscle cells of the skins are the erector of pili causing hair to stand erect in response to cold, heat or fear.\n\nFigure 5.4 Smooth muscles",
    ".\n\n5.1.2. Mechanism of actions of skeletal muscles\n\nMechanisms of action of muscles are the process of activations of muscle cells to generate tension or contract for movements.\n\nSkeletal muscles are bundles of muscle fibers with single large cells formed by the fusion of many individual cells during development.\n\nMost of the cytoplasm consists of myofibrils of cylindrical bundles of two types of filaments of thick filaments of myosin and thin filaments of actin where each is each organized as a chain of contractile unit called sarcomeres.\n\nActin and myosin are both proteins found in every type of muscle tissue where the thick myosin filaments and thin actin filaments work together to generate muscle contractions and movement.\n\nMyosin is a type of molecular motor that converts chemical energy released from ATP into mechanical energy used to pull the actin filaments along causing muscle fibers to contract and generate.\n\nActin filaments, together with myosin are responsible for many types of cell movements. The most noticeable form of movement is muscle contraction, which has provided the model for understanding actin- myosin interactions and the motor activity of myosin molecules.\n\nWhat are mechanisms of action?\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLab-based activity 5.1: Laboratory works Objectives: observe and identify three cell types Materials Microscopes, cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles specimens, and Knives.\n\nMethods \uf0b7 Prepare specimen for all the three muscle types \uf0b7 Set a wet mounting of each specimen taken from each muscle cell \uf0b7 Observe the specimen samples under the microscope \uf0b7 Write a lab report on the protocol.\n\nAssessments What are the differences among the three types of muscles?\n\nDraw a diagram of each type of muscle Explain the relationships between the structures and functions of muscles.",

In natural movements, the activity of locomotors and muscle contractions is multifaceted to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner.\n\nMuscle contraction occurs when the two-inter-digitizing filaments, the thin actin and the thick myosin filaments, slide pass each other.\n\nThere are three types of muscle contractions:\n\n1. Isometric: does not change the length (Figure 5.6a).\n\n2. Concentric: shortening the muscle (Figure 5.6b).\n\n3. Eccentric: lengthening the muscle fibers (Figure 5.6c).\n\n5.1.3. The human axial and appendicular skeletons\n\nThe human skeletal system is a complex structure with two distinct divisions composed of fused and individual bones supported by ligaments, tendons, muscles, and cartilage.\n\nHumans are born with over 300 bones, but many of the bones fuse between birth and the end of maturity and remain with the average number of 206 bones in an adult skeleton.\n\nBones have three different layers made from three different kinds of cells. The general structure of bones is a combination of a protein called collagen and a molecule called calcium phosphate that weave together to form a strong and lightweight structure.\n\nBones are composed of four types of cells. These are: \uf0b7 Osteoblasts involve in new bone formation.\n\n\uf0b7 Osteocytes are mature bone cells that help to mature bones of newborns.\n\n\uf0b7 Osteoclasts break down bones and help them to form into correct shapes.\n\n\uf0b7 Osteoprogenitor are important in repair of fracture.\n\nBased on their shapes, there are four different types of bones in the human body:\n\n1. Long bones have long and thin shapes.\n\n2. Short bones have squat and cubed shapes.\n\n3. Flat bones have flattened and broad surfaces.\n\n4. Irregular bones have shapes that do not conform to the above three types.\n\n5. Sesamoid bones are small, flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed\n\nWhat are human skeletons?",

It includes skeletal elements, limbs, shoulder-supporting girdle, pectoral, pelvic girdle, and joined appendages. An appendicular skeleton is involved in the locomotion of lower limbs and manipulation of objects in the upper limbs. It also consists of six major regions (Table 5.3).\n\nTable 5.3 Parts of the appendicular skeleton Appendicular skeleton parts Number of bones Shoulder girdles Pelvis Arms and forearms Thighs and legs Hands Feet and ankles Sum Total number of bones in the human body = axial + appendicular = 80 + 126 = 206",

The function of the human reproductive system is to produce and deposit sperms in males and egg cells in females. Internal fertilization by sexual intercourse occurs when the male inserts his penis into a female\u2019s vagina and ejaculates sperm that pass through the cervix into the uterus and the fallopian tubes for the fertilization of the ovum (egg).\n\n5.2.1. Human reproductive system (Male and Female)\n\nThe male reproductive systems The male reproductive system contains the external genital organs (penis, testes, and the scrotum) and internal parts (prostate gland, vas deferens, and urethra) that work together to produce sperm (male gametes), male sex hormones, and other components of the semen (Figure 5.9).\n\n1. The penis\n\nThe penis is the male copulatory organ. The penis contains soft, spongy tissue as well as muscles, fibrous tissue, veins, arteries, and the urethra. These allow the penis to perform its functions. It has urinary and sexual functions. The sexual function of the penis can be described as two stages: erection and ejaculation.\n\nAt the end of this section, the student will be able to: \uf0b7 Describe female and male reproductive systems \uf0b7 Explain gametogenesis \uf0b7 Explain menstrual cycle \uf0b7 List types contraceptive mechanisms and uses \uf0b7 Describe infertilities in males and females \uf0b7 Explain the spread, prevention or treatments methods of STIS/ HIV Why is the human reproductive system necessary for the continuity of human species?\n\nSelf-questioning Before starting this section, ask yourself this question: \u201cwhat do I know about the reproductive system and what do I want to learn from this section?\u2019",
    "BIOLOGY GRADE 11\n\nUNIT FIVE RHE HUMAN BODY SYSTEM\n\nAn erection is the stiffening of the penis caused by sexual arousal and/or physical stimulation. It is also normal for erections to occur during sleep and upon waking. An erection occurs when there is an increased flow of blood into the corpus cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. During an erection, arteries supplying the erectile tissues will dilate (widen), causing the penis to engorge (fill) with blood. The engorgement compresses the veins through which blood usually exits the penis. This \"traps\" the blood and helps sustain the erection.\n\n2. Urethra\n\nThe urethra is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the urinary meatus for the removal of urine from the body. In males, the urethra allows for the passage of urine from the bladder to the outside of the body (urination) and is also responsible for the expulsion of sperm during ejaculation.\n\n3. The scrotum\n\nThe scrotum is a sack of thick skin that protects the testes and controls the temperature of the testes for suitable sperm creation. It contains seminal vesicles, vas deferens, testicles (testes), and prostate gland that constitute all the remaining components of the male reproductive system.\n\n4. Testes\n\nTestes are oval pair bodies found in the scrotum with two primary functions: Production of testosterone or male sex hormones and sperm (spermatogenesis).\n\nTable 5.4 summary of male reproductive structures and their function Structure Function testes\n\n\u2022 produce sperm cells\n\n\u2022 produce the hormone testosterone\n\nseminiferous tubules\n\n\u2022 produce immature sperm cells\n\nepididymis\n\n\u2022 matures and stores sperm cells in coiled tubules\n\nvas deferens\n\n\u2022 carries sperm from the epididymis to its junction with the\n\nurethra seminal vesicle\n\n\u2022 secretes fructose into the semen, which provides energy for\n\nthe sperm prostate gland\n\n\u2022 secretes an alkaline buffer into the semen to protect the\n\nsperm from the acidic environment of the vagina Cowper\u2019s gland\n\n\u2022 secretes mucus-rich fluids into the semen that may protect\n\nthe sperm from acids in the urethra urethra\n\n\u2022 carries semen during ejaculation\n\n\u2022 carries urine from the bladder to the exterior of the body\n\npenis\n\n\u2022 deposits sperm into the vagina during ejaculation\n\n\u2022 contains the urethra",
    "BIOLOGY GRADE 11 STUDENT TEXTBOOK\n\nFigure 5.9 Male reproductive systems The Female Reproductive Systems The female reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, accessory glands, and external genital organs (Figure 5.10). Its functions include producing gametes called eggs, secreting sex hormones (such as estrogen), providing a site for fertilization, gestating a fetus if fertilization occurs, giving birth to a baby.\n\nThe internal reproductive organs include: \uf0b7 Labia majora: The labia majora (\u201clarge lips\u201d) enclose and protect the other external reproductive organs.\n\nDuring puberty, hair growth occurs on the skin of the labia majora, which also contain sweat and oil-secreting glands.\n\n\uf0b7 Labia minora: The labia minora (\u201csmall lips\u201d) can have a variety of sizes and shapes. They lie just inside the labia majora, and surround the openings to the vagina (the canal that joins the lower part of the uterus to the outside of the body) and urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body). This skin is very delicate and can become easily irritated and swollen.\n\n\uf0b7 Bartholin\u2019s glands: These glands are located next to the vaginal opening on each side and produce a fluid (mucus) secretion.\n\n\uf0b7 Clitoris: The two labia minora meet at the clitoris, a small, sensitive protrusion that is comparable to the penis in",

Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation and can become erect.\n\nThe internal reproductive organs include: \uf0b7 Vagina: The vagina is a canal that joins the cervix (the lower part of the uterus) to the outside of the body. It is also known as the birth canal.\n\n\uf0b7 Uterus (womb): The uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is the home to a developing fetus. The uterus is divided into two parts: the cervix, which is the lower part that opens into the vagina; and the main body of the uterus, called the corpus. The corpus can easily expand to hold a developing baby. A canal through the cervix allows sperm to enter and menstrual blood to exit.\n\n\uf0b7 Ovaries: The ovaries are small, oval- shaped glands that are located on either side of the uterus. The ovaries produce eggs and hormones.\n\n\uf0b7 Fallopian tubes: These are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as pathways for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus.\n\nFertilization of an egg by sperm normally occurs in the fallopian tubes.\n\nThe fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where it implants into the uterine lining.\n\nTable 5.5 Summary of female reproductive structures and their function Structure Function ovaries\n\n\u2022\n\nproduce the hormones estrogen and progesterone\n\n\u2022 site of ova (egg cell) development and ovulation\n\nfallopian tubes (oviducts)\n\n\u2022 carry the ovum from the ovary to the uterus\n\n\u2022 usually the site of fertilization\n\nfimbria\n\n\u2022 sweep the ovum into the oviduct following ovulation\n\nuterus (womb)\n\n\u2022 pear-shaped organ in which the embryo and fetus develop\n\n\u2022 involved in menstruation",

    "BIOLOGY GRADE 11\n\nUNIT FIVE RHE HUMAN BODY SYSTEM\n\nSpermatogenesis Spermatogenesis is the process by which haploid (n) spermatozoa develop from germ cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testis.\n\nMale gamete production starts at puberty and takes place in the testis. The testes also produce the male hormone called androgen (testicular hormone). Germinal epithelium lines the seminiferous tubules. The majority of cells here are cuboidal and called primordial germ cells or PGCs. These immature male germ cells undergo successive mitotic and meiotic divisions to produce sperms.\n\nThe diploid primordial germ cells are present in the lining of the seminiferous tubules of testis. Some cells which are tall and somatic are called Sertoli cells. They help in the nourishment of the developing sperms and are also called nurse cells.\n\nAt sexual maturity, the undifferentiated primordial germ cells or PGCs of seminiferous tubules divide several times by mitosis to produce large number of sperm mother cells or spermatogonia. Spermatogonia are diploid and possess 46 chromosomes. They then go through mitotic division and generate primary spermatocytes which undergo meiosis to form two haploid cells known as secondary spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte has 23 chromosomes. Second meiotic division occurs in secondary spermatocytes, resulting in production of four equal and haploid spermatids. The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (sperm) by the process of spermiogenesis. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells.\n\nMaturation of the sperm cells takes place in the epididymis where it is secreted in the form of semen during puberty.\n\nOogenesis Oogenesis is the development of female egg cells found in the outermost layers of the ovaries germ cell oogonium and ends with one to two million cells in the embryogenesis.\n\nIt undergoes the primary oocyte development that begins with meiotic division. Oogenesis arrests division as it develops in the follicle and gives rise to a haploid (n) cell oocyte of a smaller polar body called oogenesis.

The duration of the cycles averages about 28 days. However, the period that might differ in different women can range from 20 days to 45 days. The difference in the duration is associated with decreased fertility.\n\nEvents of the menstrual cycles are phases of follicular, ovulation, luteal and menstruation. Phases (events) of menstrual cycles are: \uf0b7 The follicular phase: is the event when the anterior pituitary produces and secret estrogens called follicles stimulated hormones (FSH) that inhibit the secretion of negative feedback to prevent the growth of other follicles.\n\n\uf0b7 The ovulation phase: an event when ovulation takes place in the midway through the cycle (days 12-14) and estrogen stimulates the anterior pituitary to secret luteinizing hormones (LH) as positive feedbacks to surge the release of an egg (secondary oocyte) as ovulation.\n\n\uf0b7 The Luteal phase: rupture follicle develops into a slowly degenerating corpus luteum to secret high levels of progesterone and lower levels of estrogen. Both estrogen and progesterone act on the uterus to thicken the endometrial lining in preparation for pregnancy and inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH to prevent any follicle from developing.\n\n\uf0b7 The Menstruation phase: in the menstrual cycle, if fertilization occurs, the embryo develops, implants in the endometrium and release hormones to sustain the corpus luteum.

The \u201cpositive feedback\u201d is the process in which the end products of an action cause more of that action to occur in a feedback loop. In a menstrual cycle, it is a period (days 12\u201314) during when estrogen stimulates the hypothalamus of the brain to release Gonadotropin Releasing Hormones (GnRH) that stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete Luteinizing Hormones (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormones\n\n(FSH).\n\nHormones are chemicals that coordinate different body functions by carrying messages through our blood to organs, muscles and other tissues.\n\n1. Luteinizing Hormone (LH)\n\nLH is a gonadotrophic hormone for regulating the function of the testes in men and ovaries in women.\n\n\uf0b7 In men, it stimulates cells in the testes to produce testosterone to support sperm production.\n\n\uf0b7 In women, it carries out different roles in the two halves of the menstrual cycle. In weeks one to two of the cycle, the hormone stimulates the ovarian follicles to produce the female sex hormone estradiol. Around day 14 of the cycle, a surge in LH levels causes the ovarian follicle to rupture and release a mature oocyte (egg) from the ovary called ovulation. For the remainder of the cycle (weeks three to four), the remnants of the ovarian follicle form a corpus luteum to produce progesterone required to support the early stages of pregnancy. The rise of the levels LH is a negative feedback and too much LH is an indicator of infertility.\n\nInquiry activity 5.6 Homeworks\n\n1.

Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)\n\nFSH is a hormone that plays a role in sexual development, reproduction and affects ovaries and testicles.\n\nWomen are born with all the eggs and the ovarian reserve consists of one to two million eggs at birth of which around 400,000 eggs reach puberty, 400 eggs mature and ovulate throughout our reproductive years. The brain releases the hormone at the beginning of each cycle to stimulate ovaries to grow follicles and eggs for ovulation. The progesterone maintains the uterine lining or thickness of the uterus wall and lesser it for happening pregnancy.\n\nThe rise in FSH stimulates the growth of the follicle in the ovary, produces the increasing amounts of estradiol and reduces the release of gonadotrophin hormone as negative feedback.\n\nDuring each menstrual cycle, is a rise in FSH secretion in the first half of the cycle (follicular phase) stimulates follicular growth in the ovary leading to ovulation. The ruptured follicle forms a corpus luteum that produces high levels of progesterone (luteal phase) and at the end of the cycle, the corpus luteum breaks down, progesterone production decreases and the next menstrual cycle begins as follicle stimulating hormone levels start to rise again.\n\nIn negative feedbacks, the mechanism of biochemical pathway turns off, the egg fails of fertilization, the corpus luteum dies, progesterone levels drop and the uterine lining breaks down and the woman is having a period or menstruation. The positive feedback leads to ovulation and the negative feedback leads to menstruation (Figure 5.13).\n\nFigure 5.13 Positive and negative feedbacks schema of the menstrual cycle",

Fertilization\n\nFertilization is the union of human egg and sperm cells in the ampulla of the fallopian tube to produce a zygote (Figure 5.14).\n\nThe process of fertilization occurs when 23 sets of chromosomes from a spermatozoon and 23 sets of chromosomes from an egg cell fuse together. The fertilized egg (zygote) divides repeatedly as it moves down the fallopian tube to the uterus. About six days after fertilization, the embryo attaches to the lining of the uterus, usually near the top. This process is called implantation and it is completed within nine or ten days.\n\nFigure 5.14 Fertilization\n\n2.
